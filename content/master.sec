#### Personal Software Projects

* **[secondary](https://github.com/bdzimmer/secondary)** - markup language and static site generator for creating [fictional universes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe). Includes many features specifically for worldbuilding such as timelines and family trees, but also functions as a general purpose tool for tracking information and tasks.

Built around a tiny, pure functional [vector math library](https://github.com/bdzimmer/orbits/blob/master/src/main/scala/bdzimmer/orbits/Vectors.scala).
* **[pixel-editor](https://github.com/bdzimmer/pixel-editor)** - create pixel art sprites, tiles, and backgrounds with configurable limitations that simulate classic game consoles and old computer hardware.

#### Talks

* **Build Your Own Data Analytics Cluster** - [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWVh2oh54sU) - [slides](https://github.com/tcrug/2015-meeetups/blob/master/January/Build%20Your%20Own%20Data%20Analytics%20Cluster%2020150122.pdf) - demonstration of a Big Data stack with an n-gram viewer application I created using Cassandra, Spark, and R / Shiny.
