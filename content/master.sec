* **Research:** image and mesh processing, machine learning, software and mathematical optimization
* **Interests:** functional programming, abstract algebra

#### Personal Software Projects

* **[modeling](https://github.com/bdzimmer/modeling)** - functional library for programmatic 3D modeling. Create complex objects, assemble scenes, and render with Blender.
* **[symbols](https://github.com/bdzimmer/symbols)** - tools for geometric motion graphics, text rendering, image manipulation, and compositing.
